For this kata, we’re going to write a program to solve a simple problem, and
we’re going to write it with three different sub-objectives. Our program is
going do process the dictionary we used in previous kata, this time looking
for all six letter words which are composed of two concatenated smaller words.

For example:
  al + bums => albums
  bar + ely => barely
  be + foul => befoul
  con + vex => convex
  here + by => hereby
  jig + saw => jigsaw
  tail + or => tailor
  we + aver => weaver

Write the program three times.

The first time, make program as readable as you can make it.
The second time, optimize the program to run as fast as you can make it.
The third time, write as extendible a program as you can.
